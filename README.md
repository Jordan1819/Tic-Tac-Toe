# Tic-Tac-Toe

# Overview

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game that I created using C++. My purpose for this project was to begin learning C++. This software uses arrays, functions, and conditional statements. Overall, this was a great way for me to begin understandign the syntax and flow of C++, and I have truly gained an appreciation for the potential and power of this language.

# Development Environment

This software was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio Code and the C++ programming language. I also used several libraries within CPP.

# Future Work

- Add more color or animation to the game board.
- Allow players to customize the symbols they place on the board.
- Allow players to keep track of how many games each of them has won/ lost.
